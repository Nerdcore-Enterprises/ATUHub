# ATUHub

### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome. If you're reading this, you are in the right place.

Here, we will push changes to the app and they will automatically be updated through Expo. For any problems or bugs on the app, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/Nerdcore-Enterprises/ATUHub/issues/new).

There are a couple of things that need to be done before starting development on the app, please refer to the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/HG6URZKY/nerdcore-atu-hub) page and the [OneNote](https://arkansastechu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ddover1_atu_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={40c8fe3c-aa8d-43b2-88f7-a6942836362e}).

We will eventually work with Codespaces, although I need to figure out how we can work together on it. For now, to clone this repository, I recommend these steps:
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**
2. Open the **Explorer** in VSC
3. **Clone Repository** (*Make sure you are signed in with your GitHub account*)
    - **Clone from GitHub**
    - Select **Nerdcore-Enterprises/ATUHub**
    - Select Directory
4. Done.

### Todo:
- [X] Create repository.
- [ ] Create branches for production and development.
- [ ] Create Expo starter app.
- [ ] Connect the app with a database. Expo does not provide one. Vercel does, but is limited to 256 MB without a pro account.
- [ ] Create starter page.
