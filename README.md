# ATUHub

Welcome. If you're reading this, you are in the right place.

Here, we will push changes to the app and they will automatically be updated through Expo.

For any issues, refer to the issues tab.

### Todo:
- [X] Create repository.
- [ ] Create branches for production and development.
- [ ] Create Expo starter app.
- [ ] Connect the app with a database. Expo does not provide one. Vercel does, but is limited to 256 MB without a pro account.
- [ ] Create starter page.
